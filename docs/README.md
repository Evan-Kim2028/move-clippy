# Move Clippy Docs

Internal documentation lives here to keep the repository root focused on source code.

- [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md): local workflow, error handling, telemetry, fixtures, and test expectations.
- [`STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md): rule stability policy, promotion criteria, and configuration reference.

Add new internal guides in this directory (for example, architecture notes or release runbooks) so contributors know where to look.

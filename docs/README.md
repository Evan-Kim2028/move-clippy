# Move Clippy Docs

Internal documentation lives here to keep the repository root focused on source code.

## Core Documentation

- [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md): Local workflow, error handling, telemetry, fixtures, and test expectations.
- [`STABILITY.md`](STABILITY.md): Rule stability policy, promotion criteria, and configuration reference.

## Lint References

- [`SECURITY_LINTS.md`](SECURITY_LINTS.md): Security lint reference with audit sources and detection methods.
- [`SEMANTIC_LINT_STATUS.md`](SEMANTIC_LINT_STATUS.md): Status of semantic lints (requires `--mode full`).

## Contributor Guides

- [`LINT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`](LINT_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md): How to develop new lints with examples and best practices.
- [`FP_PREVENTION.md`](FP_PREVENTION.md): False positive prevention methodology and testing strategies.

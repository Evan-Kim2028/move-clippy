unnecessary_public_entry:sources/single_module.move:47: 12: warning: unnecessary `entry` on a `public` function: `entry` on `public` functions limits composability as it adds restrictions, e.g. the type of each return value must have `drop`. `entry` on `public` is only meaningful in niche scenarios.

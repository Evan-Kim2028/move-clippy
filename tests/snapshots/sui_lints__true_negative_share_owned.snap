sources/main.move:29:19: capability_naming: Capability struct should be suffixed with `_cap`: `Obj_cap`
sources/main.move:44:9: share_owned_authority: Sharing `can_determine_to_be_new::Obj` (has key+store) in `share` makes it publicly accessible. This is dangerous for authority objects (capabilities). If this is intentional shared state, suppress with #[allow(lint(share_owned_authority))].
